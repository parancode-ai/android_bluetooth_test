# android_bluetooth_test

This repository contains a minimal sample demonstrating how to build a
`MediaBrowserService`-based app using the Android 14 (API 34) build system with
an `Android.bp` file.

The sample exposes an empty `MediaBrowserService` and a basic `Activity` that
connects to it. The `Android.bp` file describes an `android_app` module that can
be included in an Android build tree.
